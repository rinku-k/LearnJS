# Doubts while learning js

- Equating objects which have same content
- limitations of object comparison using JSON.stringify()
- typeof(NaN) is number??
- NaN and Infinity are numbers?
- for...in and for...of difference?
  - for..in is for keys, best for objects.
  - for..of is for values, only for arrays, doesnt work for objects
- Ways to create copy of array, copy of object?
  - | Object | Array |
    | ------ | ----- |
    | Object.assign() | arr.slice() |
    | spread operator | spread operator |
- Differences between object and map
  | Object | Map |
  |--------| ---|
  | keys converted to string| all types supported, even object |
  | loop: integer props sorted, then in creation order | creation order only |
- Functions common across ds: objects, arrays, maps, sets
